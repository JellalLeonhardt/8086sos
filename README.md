A simple os on 8086 for my GF to learn assembly language and OS.
It's very simple and special since it can do the task switch, to make it, just press any key on your keyboard. :)

to run the 8086sos, you can use bochs, qemu, virtualbox, vmware, even real pc, whatever, any x86 machine can run it.
